    "We can use the regression equation to predict the weight gain and mean weight gain of a chick with x=0.84, however, since the x value is so far away from the values used in the regression model, there is a considerably higher extrapolation penalty. It's assumed that the weight gain will continue to be related linearly with the amount of lysine consumed by the chick. I imagine that the relationship will not be linear indefinitely, because perhaps the lysine starts becoming toxic at higher doses, or maybe the chicks explode, but I am not able to comment on whether 42.6 grams of weight gain is realistic for a chick or not."

A fuel usage of 628 gallons actually falls within the 99% prediction interval, so not that far-fetched."
